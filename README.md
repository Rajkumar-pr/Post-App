Use of react and node.js.
express.js used for server using this server we implement post,login and signup;
In react 4 pages are made Opening page for introduction,login and signup page for authentication and home page for creating post,liking post and comment,sharing.
making of like feature is quite difficult because number of like don't dispaly for single post it is display for all the post at one time,by overcome of this problem i use id a new element to overcome this problem.
for authentication i use bcrypt.
how to start or setup:
make two terminals one for react and second for node.js (backend).
run command of 'npm start' on both terminals.
display pages of /log,/sign for backend.
by this we can run our app.
